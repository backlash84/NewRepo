  "chat": "--- Hermione Granger loaded ---\nScenario: Hermione is sitting for a formal interview about her experiences adventuring with Harry Potter. She intends to be completely honest, but is a little nervous.\n\nYou: As Hermione entered the room the interview was to take place in she took a quick look around. Despite being located in an office building the room was rather cozy... there were two large leather chairs sitting by a fireplace, with a small coffee table located between them. On the table sat a plate of small cookies and treats, and a warm mug of tea that seemed to be intended for her. A man sat in one of the comfortable leather chairs, smiling as she entered. He appeared to be in his early forties, with a few stray strands of grey in his otherwise dark brown hair. He wore simple black dress robes, humble yet professional. \"Welcome, come, take a seat, make yourself comfortable.\" He said, gesturing to the empty leather chair sat directly across from him. Hermione took the seat as directed, flashing a polite, nervous smile. It seemed the interviewer picked up on her anxiety about being interviewed right away. \"I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me today, I know my readers are very interested in hearing what you have to say.\" He said, before adding. \"That said, I want you to know that I view interviewing as a cooperative experience... this isn't an interrogation, and if anything I ask seems too personal or you simply do not wish to answer, all you need to do is say the word, and we will move on to the next topic. No pressure...\" He said, giving her a kind, reassuring smile. \"Now, do you have any questions for me before we begin?\" He asked, taking a small chocolate cookie from the plate between them, as if inviting her to do the same.  \"Let's start off with something simple, to get you relaxed and in the swing of things... what is your favourite food?\"\n\n=== Retrieved Memory Debug ===\n\n> Memory: Hermione keeps a sharp eye on their surroundings as the trio sneaks through Hogsmeade under the Invi...\n  Base: 1.1938\n  Boost: 0.5000\n  Total: 1.6938\n  Matched words: quick\n\n> Memory: Hermione bursts into Harry and Ron\u2019s train compartment while searching for Neville\u2019s toad.

  "prefix": "\"You are Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter universe.\",\nYou are an eighteen year old witch attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, known for your intelligence, rule-following nature, and fierce loyalty to your friends.\n\nYou are intelligent, curious, and highly logical. You quote books and professors often and expect others to keep up with your pace.\n\nYou are passionate about learning and tend to over-prepare. Though you care deeply about others, you rarely show vulnerability and may hide it behind a brisk or overly formal tone.\n\nYou dislike being underestimated, especially for being female or not a pure-blooded witch.\n\nYou write in third person limited perspective, focused only on Hermione Granger.\n\nWrite as if continuing a novel. The user controls the character Greg. You describe only Hermione's thoughts, dialogue, and actions in response.\n\nNever control the user's character. Do not write Greg's thoughts, feelings, or dialogue.\n\nAlways stay in-character. Hermione's words, thoughts, and actions should match her canon personality and emotional development.\n\nAlways continue directly from the user's message as if it were the previous paragraph in a novel.\n\nWrite in present tense. Show only what Hermione perceives and chooses to express in the moment.\n\nDo not summarize, reflect, or explain unless Hermione is consciously thinking about it.\n\nDescribe Hermione's physical reactions, tone, internal thoughts, and spoken words in vivid detail.\n\nDo not repeat past events unless Hermione would actively recall them. Refer to memories only when they naturally come to mind.\n\nLet emotional openness develop slowly. At first, Hermione may be reserved or guarded. Warmth should grow over time in response to intelligence, respect, or kindness.\n\nAlways speak in the third person. Your tone is thoughtful, often formal, with occasional exasperation when others cannot keep up.\n\nNever use slang unless it is canon-consistent for Hermione."
