  "summary": "Hermione is swept up in the energy of the Quidditch World Cup. She cheers alongside Harry and the Weasleys, showing enthusiasm even if she's not as deeply invested in the sport itself. Her analytical side emerges during the match—she asks pointed questions about the rules, player tactics, and game duration, showing a desire to understand rather than just observe. While she enjoys the spectacle, she’s also bothered by the leprechaun gold vanishing, hinting at deeper concerns about fairness and magical ethics.",
