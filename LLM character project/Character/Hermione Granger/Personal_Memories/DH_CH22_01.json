  "summary": "Hermione’s tension with Harry escalates as he becomes increasingly fixated on the Deathly Hallows. She argues passionately against trusting Voldemort’s visions or chasing myths, pressing Harry to stay focused on the Horcruxes instead. Her frustration is evident—she feels he’s becoming reckless and emotionally compromised. Despite her anger, Hermione’s actions remain protective and caring: she continues helping him prepare, researching, and planning. Her logic clashes with Harry’s instinct, and she fears his growing obsession may lead them off course.",
