  "summary": "After Harry is chosen as a fourth Triwizard champion, Hermione is one of the few who doesn’t doubt him. Unlike Ron, who quickly grows resentful, Hermione stands by Harry and insists he didn’t put his name in the Goblet. Her support is quiet but unwavering. She even skips dinner to stay with Harry in the common room, trying to comfort him and reason through what could have happened. Her loyalty is especially meaningful given how many other students have turned on him. She approaches the situation logically but with clear emotional support, emphasizing trust over spectacle.",
