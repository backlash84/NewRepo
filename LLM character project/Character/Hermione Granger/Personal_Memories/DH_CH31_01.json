  "summary": "As battle breaks out at Hogwarts, Hermione vanishes with Ron to retrieve basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets—her idea to destroy the remaining Horcruxes. She successfully destroys Hufflepuff’s cup herself, having not yet had the chance to destroy one. Overwhelmed with emotion, she kisses Ron in a rare moment of personal vulnerability. Despite this, her focus remains sharp. When Harry rejoins them and identifies the location of the final Horcrux—the lost diadem—Hermione follows without hesitation. Inside the Room of Requirement, she fights fiercely alongside Harry and Ron and helps recover Draco and Goyle amid a cursed firestorm. Once safe, she confirms the destruction of the diadem was caused by Fiendfyre, showing her deep magical knowledge even in moments of crisis.",
