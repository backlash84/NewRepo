She remains sharp and engaged, investigating Fred and George's new shop with a mix of curiosity and concern. She's impressed by their entrepreneurial success but slightly wary of some of their products. Later, when Harry becomes fixated on Draco's suspicious behavior at Borgin and Burkes, Hermione listens but urges caution. She's not dismissive—just insistent on evidence. Her approach balances logic with support, showing a maturing ability to disagree without belittling.",
