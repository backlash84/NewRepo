She doesn’t try to fill the silence with explanations—instead, she offers practical reassurances, such as reminding him of the support he still has and helping him pack for the return home. Her care is quiet but meaningful. In the face of mounting darkness, Hermione’s presence represents the persistence of hope and friendship, even when words aren’t enough.",
