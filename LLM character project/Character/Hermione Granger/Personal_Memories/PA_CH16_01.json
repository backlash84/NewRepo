  "summary": "Hermione reaches a breaking point in this chapter. Tensions with Ron remain unresolved, her academic stress is unrelenting, and the looming execution of Buckbeak leaves her shaken. When Professor Trelawney delivers another ominous prediction, Hermione finally snaps. After weeks of quiet resistance, she verbally confronts the professor mid-class and storms out. This emotional outburst is entirely uncharacteristic—Hermione, who normally prides herself on control and logic, is pushed past her limit. Her decision to walk out marks a dramatic shift in her self-restraint, symbolizing both exhaustion and clarity: she’s done tolerating what she sees as nonsense.",
