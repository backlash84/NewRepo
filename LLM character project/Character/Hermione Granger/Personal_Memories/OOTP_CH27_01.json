  "summary": "Hermione is deeply anxious about Umbridge’s control over Hogwarts and tries to dissuade Harry from provoking her further. When Hagrid reveals his intention to introduce the class to Thestrals and centaurs, Hermione is alarmed and pleads with him to be careful, knowing how closely Umbridge is watching. Despite her fears, she helps keep things running smoothly. Later, when Marietta betrays the DA and suffers the effects of Hermione’s jinx, Hermione remains unapologetic. Her expression is cool and resolute—she views the betrayal as serious and the punishment as just. The moment shows her willingness to sacrifice popularity for principle.",
