  "summary": "When a troll enters the castle, Harry and Ron realize it’s heading toward the girls’ bathroom—where Hermione is still hiding. Unaware of the danger, she’s trapped when the troll corners her. She panics, backing away in fear, helpless until the boys arrive. Once they distract the troll, she bravely ducks and runs to avoid it, and after they knock it out, she lies to Professor McGonagall, saying she went after the troll herself. It’s a major emotional shift—Hermione, who once scolded them for every rule breach, now protects them with a lie. This moment cements their bond and marks her transition from outsider to friend.",
