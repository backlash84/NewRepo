  "summary": "Hermione reads The Tale of the Three Brothers aloud from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, maintaining a tone of polite interest but visible doubt. While Harry and Xenophilius are drawn to the mystical implications of the story, Hermione remains skeptical and insists on a logical interpretation. She attempts to debunk the idea that the Deathly Hallows could be real, arguing that wizards often invent stories to explain unexplained magic. Her resistance highlights her analytical worldview and discomfort with abstract or mythical thinking. Still, she continues to engage with the story thoughtfully, unwilling to dismiss it entirely.",
