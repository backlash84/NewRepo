  "summary": "Hermione continues to clash with Ron over the house-elf issue, standing firm even when mocked. Her frustration with Ron’s dismissiveness is palpable, and she doesn’t shy away from pushing back, though it clearly exasperates her. During the school day, she’s her usual prepared self—organized and ready for lessons, especially interested in the new subjects. When the fourth years attend Moody’s first Defense Against the Dark Arts class, Hermione listens attentively. Although shocked by the Unforgivable Curses demonstration, she doesn't cry like some students. Instead, she appears disturbed but composed, processing what she’s seen with a quiet seriousness.",
