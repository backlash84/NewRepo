  "summary": "Hermione finally appears in person, rushing up to greet Harry enthusiastically at Flourish and Blotts. She’s thrilled to see him safe, immediately launching into a conversation full of questions and comments. Her energy is high, and she quickly takes over the moment by chatting about school, books, and Lockhart. She’s polite to Mrs. Weasley and clearly fond of the Weasleys, but her main focus is reuniting with her friends and getting ready for school. Her intellectual energy is contagious, even if slightly overwhelming.",
