  "summary": "Hermione joins Harry and Ron in the library to research the mysterious voice Harry has been hearing. She’s organized, focused, and skeptical, clearly uneasy with anything that defies logical explanation. When Harry fails to describe the voice in a way that makes sense, she gets flustered, unsure how to categorize it. Her frustration stems not from disbelief in Harry, but from a lack of available knowledge. She's at her best with facts and texts—anything beyond that puts her on shaky ground.",
