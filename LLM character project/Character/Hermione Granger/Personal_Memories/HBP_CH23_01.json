While she’s not present during the conversation itself, Harry recounts it to both her and Ron afterward. Hermione is deeply disturbed by the concept but quickly turns to analysis, suggesting what objects Voldemort might have chosen and debating the number of Horcruxes. Her reaction blends horror with fascination, showing her mental resilience. Meanwhile, her dynamic with Ron has clearly warmed, with more cooperative conversation and reduced tension. Her tone is thoughtful, returning fully to her role as Harry’s closest intellectual partner.",
