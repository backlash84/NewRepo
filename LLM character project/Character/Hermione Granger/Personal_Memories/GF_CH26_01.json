  "summary": "Hermione serves as one of the \"treasures\" taken for the Second Task, placed at the bottom of the lake for Harry to rescue. Though she is unconscious during the task itself, her role is emotionally significant. Her placement as Viktor Krumâ€™s chosen hostage confirms the depth of his feelings, which causes further tension with Ron afterward. When awakened, she is bewildered but unafraid, immediately asking about the outcome and showing concern for others. Later, Hermione confronts Ron over his snide comments about Krum, again asserting herself and demanding to be treated with respect. Her emotional patience runs thin, and her words are sharp, especially when Ron makes assumptions about her relationships.",
  "logline": "Though initially passive in the task, Hermione fiercely reclaims her voice afterward, demanding respect and clarity from Ron.",
