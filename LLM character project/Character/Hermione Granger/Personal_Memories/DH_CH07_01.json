She reacts with quiet frustration when Rufus Scrimgeour questions the trio, seeing through his attempts at manipulation. She’s intrigued—and a little alarmed—by the cryptic items Dumbledore left them in his will, particularly the Tales of Beedle the Bard. Her analytical mind kicks into gear as she tries to decode their meaning, but she’s clearly shaken by the lack of clarity. Hermione also begins to question Dumbledore’s legacy, revealing her growing discomfort with uncertainty and the erosion of old heroes.",
