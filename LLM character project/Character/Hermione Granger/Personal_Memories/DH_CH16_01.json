  "summary": "Hermione accompanies Harry to Godric’s Hollow with a mix of reverence and apprehension. She’s careful and practical, casting Disillusionment charms and urging caution, but she understands the emotional weight of the journey for Harry. Her empathy is evident in how she supports his desire to visit his parents’ graves. However, when they fall into Bathilda Bagshot’s trap, Hermione’s instincts kick in—she fights to protect Harry and barely manages to get them out alive. She is furious with herself afterward, shaken and guilt-ridden over the failure to sense the danger sooner.",
