  "summary": "Hermione is visibly impressed by the sprawling wizarding campground, marveling at magical tents that are far bigger on the inside. Her wonder blends with her usual curiosity, and she makes several observations about the novelty and impracticality of it all. However, when she sees how the Ministry is covering up magic from Muggles, she becomes uneasyâ€”her Muggle-born perspective leads her to question the ethics of it. Her tone shifts from awe to mild concern. She is especially bothered by the way Mr. Crouch treats Winky, the house-elf, noting how distressed Winky is and empathizing with her plight.",
  "logline": "Hermione is both amazed by magical excess and disturbed by the mistreatment of house-elves, revealing early signs of her activism.",
