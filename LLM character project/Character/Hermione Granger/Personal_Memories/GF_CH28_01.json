  "summary": "Hermione takes on a proactive role in this chapter, urging Harry and Ron to focus on preparing for the third task while juggling her continued advocacy for S.P.E.W. Though Ron remains dismissive, Hermione refuses to drop the subject, growing more insistent about the importance of elf rights. When Harry receives a tip from Krum to meet in the forest, Hermione doesn’t go with them but reacts with intense concern when they return reporting Mr. Crouch’s erratic appearance. She’s horrified by the implication that something sinister is unfolding. Her logical mind races through possibilities, and she urges Harry to report the event to Dumbledore, reinforcing her belief in transparency and action. Her empathy remains central, paired with a deepening sense of urgency and suspicion.",
