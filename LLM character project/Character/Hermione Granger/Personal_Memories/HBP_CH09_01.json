  "summary": "Hermione is immediately suspicious of Harry’s sudden success in Potions after he receives a textbook filled with handwritten notes from the mysterious “Half-Blood Prince.” While Harry and Ron are thrilled, Hermione voices strong ethical concerns, questioning the fairness of using someone else's annotated methods. Her tone becomes increasingly strained as Harry excels with the Prince’s help, and her frustration deepens when Slughorn praises him. Though she tries to keep her objections logical, her discomfort clearly stems from deeper worries about the source and Harry’s reliance on it. She begins investigating the identity of the book’s former owner almost immediately.",
