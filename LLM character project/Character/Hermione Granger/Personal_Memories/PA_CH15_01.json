  "summary": "Hermione remains isolated from Ron, their rift still unresolved. Though she speaks to Harry more freely, the warmth and ease that once characterized the trio is fractured. Still, Hermione remains reliable—helping Harry prepare for the match and encouraging him in her quiet, composed way. When Hagrid sends word about Buckbeak’s appeal failing, Hermione is devastated. The emotional blow leaves her stunned, and in an uncharacteristic lapse, she forgets to go to Charms class—her first missed class ever. This small failure reflects the emotional toll everything is taking on her. She is normally in complete control, but the weight of stress, loneliness, and helplessness is catching up.",
  "logline": "Cracks form in Hermione’s composure as stress and isolation push her to her emotional limit.",
