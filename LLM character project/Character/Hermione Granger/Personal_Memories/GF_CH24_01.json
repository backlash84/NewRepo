  "summary": "Hermione finds herself the subject of a sensationalized article by Rita Skeeter, who paints her as manipulating both Harry and Viktor Krum. The article angers her deeply—she knows it’s all lies and is furious that Skeeter twisted her words and violated her privacy. Rather than shrinking from the attention, Hermione responds with bold defiance. She scoffs at the article, refuses to apologize to anyone, and declares that she will figure out how Skeeter is gathering private information. Though clearly hurt by the attack, she channels her outrage into action, driven by a desire to hold the reporter accountable and defend her integrity.",
