  "summary": "Hermione remains emotionally taut as Lupin and Sirius begin to explain the truth about Peter Pettigrew. Though clearly frightened and wary of Sirius, she listens carefully and questions their claims, trying to make sense of what sounds impossible. When Lupin explains the Animagus transformation and Pettigrew’s deception, Hermione's reactions shift from disbelief to stunned comprehension. She doesn’t jump to conclusions, but her skeptical nature is tested as hard evidence mounts. Even when Ron is injured and emotionally raw, Hermione stays level-headed—still asking questions, still seeking facts before judgment.",
