  "summary": "In the quiet aftermath of Snape’s fall, Hermione joins Harry and Ron as they witness his final moments. She remains silent but observant, respecting the gravity of his death. Later, during Voldemort’s call for surrender, Hermione walks beside Harry and Ron to the Shrieking Shack, where they process Snape’s memories. Though Harry is the one who views them, Hermione’s support is steadfast—she gives him space but stays emotionally present. Her concern deepens when Harry abruptly walks away from the Great Hall; she tries to go after him but Ron stops her, sensing Harry’s need to be alone. Though she doesn't know his plan, her worry and loyalty are plain. She is grappling with the uncertainty of what comes next, unable to act but ready to follow when called.",
