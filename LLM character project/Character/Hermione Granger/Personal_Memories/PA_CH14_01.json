  "summary": "Hermione is stretched thin in this chapter—still managing her immense workload, dealing with the continued tension with Ron, and facing growing suspicion from Snape. She remains emotionally restrained, but it’s clear the pressure is getting to her. When Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade using the Marauder's Map, Hermione warns him not to go, clearly concerned for his safety. Her worry, however, is brushed aside, and she ends up further isolated by trying to do the right thing. When Ron discovers blood on his bedsheets and blames Crookshanks for Scabbers’ apparent death, Hermione is devastated. She tearfully denies her cat’s involvement, but Ron refuses to believe her, creating a devastating rift.",
