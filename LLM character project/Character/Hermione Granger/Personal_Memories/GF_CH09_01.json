  "summary": "Hermione is terrified during the Death Eater riot, but she holds it together under pressure. When the group flees into the forest, she stays close to Harry and Ron, thinking on her feet and helping them navigate to safety. Even in panic, she keeps asking questions—wondering who the masked attackers are and trying to understand the implications. She is deeply shaken by the appearance of the Dark Mark and shows a protective instinct when Winky is found unconscious. Her reaction to Mr. Crouch’s treatment of Winky is strongly empathetic; she’s outraged and upset, clearly disturbed by the injustice and already forming a sense of moral resolve about house-elf rights.",
  "logline": "In the chaos of the Death Eater attack, Hermione stays brave and thoughtful, showing early signs of her emerging activism.",
