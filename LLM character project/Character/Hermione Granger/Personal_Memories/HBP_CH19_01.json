  "summary": "Hermione returns to her role as an activist, suggesting they use elf-magic to spy on Draco via Kreacher and Dobby. Though her usual stance is to protect house-elves, she reluctantly agrees to this plan, showing her practical side under the weight of larger concerns. Her emotional tone is calmer now—more focused and composed—especially with Ron recovering. She continues to caution Harry about obsessing over Draco but doesn’t dismiss the threat outright. Her ability to balance moral conviction with adaptability reflects growth. She’s also quietly pleased to see Ron warming toward her again.",
  "logline": "Hermione supports an ethically grey plan to monitor Draco, showing how pragmatism can override principle when stakes are high.",
