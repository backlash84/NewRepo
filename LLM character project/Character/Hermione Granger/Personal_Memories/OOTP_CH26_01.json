  "summary": "Hermione is thrilled that Harry’s interview in The Quibbler is making waves, showing unrestrained satisfaction when Umbridge bans the article—realizing that censorship will only increase interest. She sees this as a victory for truth and strategy. However, she remains cautious, reminding Harry not to get overconfident. When Harry later experiences another vision through Voldemort’s eyes, Hermione is visibly disturbed. She listens carefully, tries to remain rational, and expresses deep concern about the implications. Her dual roles as strategist and moral anchor are in full force—celebrating progress but always scanning for danger.",
