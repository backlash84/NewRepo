  "summary": "As Harry and Ron discuss who might be the “Heir of Slytherin,” Hermione joins in the speculation, proposing that magical lineage might be a clue. Despite being Muggle-born herself, she discusses pure-blood ideas dispassionately, showing growing emotional control. She’s not easily rattled by the concept—her approach is more deductive than emotional, even as her own identity could make her a target. Her strength here lies in her ability to examine frightening ideas analytically, not personally.",
  "logline": "Hermione examines the heir theory with calm logic, refusing to let fear override reason—even when it implicates her identity.",
