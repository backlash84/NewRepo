  "summary": "Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron at the Leaky Cauldron, entering the room with her familiar brisk energy. She's excited, chatty, and launches into detailed accounts of her summerâ€”particularly proud of buying all her school books already. Her tone is quick and formal, almost breathless in her eagerness to reconnect. She radiates warmth, but her academic priorities remain central, as she mentions taking extra subjects and seems slightly irritated that Ron hasn't yet done his homework. Her perfectionism is intact, but her happiness to be reunited is genuine.",
