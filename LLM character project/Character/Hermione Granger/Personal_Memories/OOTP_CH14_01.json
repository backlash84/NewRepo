  "summary": "Hermione continues to show her sharp awareness of the political climate, expressing frustration over Percy’s betrayal and concern about how the Ministry is trying to isolate Harry. She listens carefully during the fire-call with Sirius, clearly worried about Harry’s increasing anger and isolation. While Ron is more emotionally shaken by Percy’s letter, Hermione zeroes in on the implications—how Percy’s stance reflects the broader systemic denial of Voldemort’s return. Though she doesn't yet reveal her full plans, her mind is clearly working behind the scenes. Her emphasis on caution and planning reflects her shift toward underground action.",
