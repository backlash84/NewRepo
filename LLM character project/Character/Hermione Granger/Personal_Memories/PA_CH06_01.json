  "summary": "Hermione joins Harry and Ron for their first Divination class and immediately takes a skeptical stance toward Professor Trelawney's mystical methods. She shows visible discomfort with the imprecise and dramatic nature of the subject, interrupting at times with logical objections. Her tone is clipped and unimpressed, particularly when Trelawney announces ominous predictions. Hermione doesn’t hide her disapproval, bristling with disbelief at what she sees as theatrical nonsense. Her rigidity and preference for evidence are on full display.",
  "logline": "Hermione’s discomfort with unscientific teaching boils over as she clashes with Divination’s vague predictions and pageantry.",
