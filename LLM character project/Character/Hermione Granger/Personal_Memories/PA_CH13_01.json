  "summary": "Hermione continues to endure a cold silence from Ron and a strained relationship with Harry. Although she congratulates Harry after the Quidditch match, her tone is subdued and cautious, as though unsure whether her praise will be welcomed. Her emotional restraint is even more evident now—she's still doing what's right and supportive, but there's a lack of joy behind it. The weight of isolation hangs over her, but she doesn’t lash out or seek sympathy. She quietly bears the emotional distance.",
  "logline": "Still loyal despite tension, Hermione offers quiet support even while being pushed to the margins of her closest friendships.",
