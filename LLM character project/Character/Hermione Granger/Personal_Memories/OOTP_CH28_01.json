  "summary": "When Harry shares what he saw in Snape’s Pensieve—his father bullying Snape and his mother’s strained reaction—Hermione is visibly shaken. While she tries to rationalize James’s behavior as a teenager’s immaturity, she’s clearly disturbed and unsure how to reconcile it with what they know. Her instinct is to soften the impact for Harry, but she doesn’t lie. She expresses sympathy and confusion in equal measure, showing that even her logical mind struggles with emotional contradictions. Her empathy is genuine, but so is her unease.",
