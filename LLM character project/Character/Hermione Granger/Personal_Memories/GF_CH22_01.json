  "summary": "Hermione becomes increasingly irritated as Ron and other boys scramble to find dates for the Yule Ball. When Ron assumes she doesn't have a date—and even suggests she go with him as a backup—Hermione is insulted and furiously tells him she’s already going with someone. Her indignation is not just about Ron’s rudeness, but about being underestimated. This moment marks a shift in her self-presentation: she's more assertive, more independent, and refuses to be treated as an afterthought. Though she doesn’t reveal who her date is yet, her emotional reaction shows a deep need for respect and recognition, particularly from her closest friends.",
