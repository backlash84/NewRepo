  "summary": "Hermione is in top form at the Burrow, blending humor, critique, and planning as the new school year approaches. She bonds with Ginny over their shared dislike of Fleur Delacour, whom they nickname 'Phlegm,' and their banter shows Hermione’s snarkier side. Yet she also keeps an eye on more serious matters—she’s skeptical of Draco Malfoy’s recent behavior and joins Harry in speculating about his intentions. When Harry voices his theory that Draco may be a Death Eater, Hermione is clearly doubtful, but not dismissive. She maintains her rational skepticism while still taking Harry’s concerns seriously.",
