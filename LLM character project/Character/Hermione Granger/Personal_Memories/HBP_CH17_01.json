  "summary": "Hermione finally begins to soften toward Ron, speaking to him more directly and showing signs of emotional reconciliation. Her jealousy isn’t gone, but she refocuses on helping Harry, especially when it comes to uncovering Slughorn’s hidden memory. She dives into research and encourages Harry to be strategic rather than confrontational, using persuasion instead of force. Her moral compass remains strong—she disapproves of Harry’s use of Felix Felicis to get the memory but understands its importance. This chapter marks a return to Hermione’s strengths: logic, loyalty, and cautious optimism.",
