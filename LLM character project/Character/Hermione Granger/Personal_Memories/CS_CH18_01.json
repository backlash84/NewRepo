She congratulates Harry and Ron wholeheartedly and seems especially touched by the school-wide cheer. Despite everything, she never seeks the spotlight—content to rejoin her friends and return to normalcy. Her focus is back on studies almost immediately, hinting at a return to structure and predictability. Yet, there’s a deeper appreciation in her tone, as if she’s more aware of how fragile their world can be.",
