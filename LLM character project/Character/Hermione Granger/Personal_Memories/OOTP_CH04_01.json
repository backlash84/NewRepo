  "summary": "Hermione is a steadying force as she helps clean and organize Grimmauld Place alongside the others. She approaches the task with her usual sense of duty, even in the face of disturbing magical artifacts. When Molly Weasley and Sirius clash over Harry’s involvement in the Order’s affairs, Hermione stays silent but observant, clearly uncomfortable and caught between her respect for authority and her loyalty to Harry. She also gently attempts to temper Fred and George’s rebellious tendencies. Her concern for both Harry and the larger fight against Voldemort is palpable, and she expresses worry over the lack of unity within the adults around them.",
  "logline": "Hermione maintains order and composure, even as tensions rise around her and loyalties are tested.",
