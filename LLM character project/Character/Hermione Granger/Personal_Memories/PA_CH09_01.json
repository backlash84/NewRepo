  "summary": "Hermione attends the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, bundled in her cloak, observing more than cheering. When Harry faints after the Dementors approach, Hermione is one of the first to rush to his side. She looks deeply concerned and later tries to rationalize what happened using logic, asking questions about what Harry heard. Her empathy is wrapped in analysis—she wants to comfort him but defaults to understanding the mechanics of the fear response. It’s her way of trying to fix things.",
