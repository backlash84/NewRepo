When Fred and George test their dangerous new invention, she doesn’t hesitate to warn them about the potential consequences—invoking Mrs. Weasley's wrath as a motivator. Though her scolding is brief, it reflects her sense of responsibility and care for others. Later, she stays quiet during Mrs. Weasley's emotional breakdown, respecting the heaviness of the moment.
