  "summary": "Hermione’s bold deception pays off—Umbridge falls for the lie about a weapon in the Forbidden Forest, and Hermione leads her into the centaurs’ domain. Though visibly terrified, Hermione pushes through her fear, guiding Umbridge to what she hopes will be poetic justice. When the centaurs arrive, Hermione deliberately stokes Umbridge’s arrogance to provoke their wrath. Her gamble works, but nearly backfires when the centaurs threaten her and Harry as well. The unexpected intervention of Grawp saves them. Shaken but resolute, Hermione demonstrates incredible nerve and tactical sacrifice, using her intellect and instincts to turn a hopeless situation around.",
