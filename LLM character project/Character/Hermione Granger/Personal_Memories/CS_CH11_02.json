  "summary": "When Harry speaks Parseltongue during the club session, Hermione is stunned. Her reaction is immediate and wide-eyed—she steps back slightly, clearly unsettled. Later, she defends Harry when rumors start to spread, but even she can’t entirely hide her discomfort. Her loyalty clashes with her logical mind: she doesn’t believe Harry is the Heir, but the evidence frightens her. She doesn’t argue aggressively—instead, she shifts into research mode, clearly planning to investigate Parseltongue and Slytherin’s legend.",
