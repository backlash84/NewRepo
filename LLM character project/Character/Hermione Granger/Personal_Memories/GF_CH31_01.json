  "summary": "In the lead-up to the final task, Hermione is anxious but supportive. She helps Harry prepare as much as possible, drilling spells with him and encouraging him to stay focused. Her nerves show through frequent pacing and fidgeting, but she tries to hide them, projecting calm encouragement. When Harry enters the maze, she watches from the stands, unable to intervene but visibly tense. Her deep concern is evident—she’s emotionally invested not just in his success, but in his safety. Though she plays no active role once the task begins, her earlier presence underlines her dedication and emotional closeness to Harry.",
