  "scene_title": "Quiet Tensions and Cold Comforts",
  "summary": "At the Burrow for Christmas, Hermione is more subdued than usual. The strained relationship with Ron is still unresolved, and she avoids engaging with him directly. When Harry shares his deepening concerns about Draco and Snape, Hermione responds cautiously, still holding to the belief that Snape is acting under Dumbledore’s orders. Her loyalty to authority and her analytical nature keep her from jumping to conclusions. Though she’s not central in this chapter, Hermione’s presence offers a steadying contrast to the emotional turbulence surrounding her, even if she’s quietly hurting.",
  "logline": "While emotional tension simmers beneath the surface, Hermione offers a calm voice of reason over the holidays.",
