  "summary": "Hermione is vocal about her disapproval of Fred and George’s attempt to enter the Triwizard Tournament using an aging potion. She’s unimpressed by their antics and scolds them for trying to cheat the age line, showing both her disdain for rule-breaking and her sense of maturity. She spends most of the chapter with Harry and Ron, observing the arrival of students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang and trying to gather information. When the champions are announced, Hermione claps supportively for Cedric, but is shocked and confused when Harry’s name comes out of the Goblet. Her immediate reaction is concern and disbelief, though she doesn’t jump to conclusions or accusations like others.",
