  "summary": "Hermione appears at the very end of this chapter, arriving at the Dursleys’ house to extract Harry. She has already magically packed his belongings and shares that she also modified her parents’ memories to protect them—erasing all trace of herself and sending them to Australia. Her tone is calm, but the emotional weight of what she’s done is immense. This act marks a major turning point for her: it’s a sacrifice that shows her complete commitment to the mission and to Harry. She is no longer just prepared—she’s already taken irreversible action.",
