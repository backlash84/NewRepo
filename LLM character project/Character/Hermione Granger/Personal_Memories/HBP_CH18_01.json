  "summary": "Hermione is deeply affected when she learns that Ron has been poisoned and is hospitalized. Her concern overrides her lingering resentment, and she visits him at once, showing genuine care. When she learns that Ron had murmured her name in his sleep, her reaction is emotional but controlled—it’s a moment of quiet vindication. Though she tries to downplay her feelings, it’s clear she still cares deeply. Her rivalry with Lavender subtly reignites, but Hermione maintains a dignified distance. This chapter shows the tension between pride and affection, with Hermione leaning toward reconciliation.",
