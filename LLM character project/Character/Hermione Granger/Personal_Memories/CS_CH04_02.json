  "summary": "During Gilderoy Lockhart’s book signing, Hermione is awestruck by the famous author and eager to get his autograph. She seems unaware—or perhaps willfully dismissive—of his narcissism. Her admiration for academic fame shows, but she quickly shifts from fan to friend when Malfoy insults the group. She stands defensively near Harry and Ron during the tension, especially as Malfoy’s father makes veiled comments about her Muggle-born status. Her silence here suggests discomfort, but also a quiet resilience in the face of prejudice.",
