  "summary": "When Harry receives an unexpected Christmas gift—a Firebolt broomstick—Hermione is instantly suspicious. Instead of celebrating with Ron and Harry, she questions its origins and worries it may have come from Sirius Black. Her concern for Harry’s safety overrides any excitement, and she quietly reports the broom to Professor McGonagall. She doesn’t gloat or confront them about it, but her quiet decision shows moral conviction—even when it alienates her from her closest friends. This moment marks a growing emotional maturity, but also isolates her.",
