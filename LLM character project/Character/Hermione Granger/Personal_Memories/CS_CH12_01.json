  "summary": "In Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, Hermione completes the long-awaited Polyjuice Potion. She takes charge, distributing doses and explaining how the transformation will work. She’s calm, focused, and clearly takes pride in the complex magical accomplishment. However, she also hides anxiety—she triple-checks everything, shows clear nerves about the result, and insists they each take theirs alone in separate stalls. This moment blends her confidence in preparation with real fear about stepping into the unknown.",
