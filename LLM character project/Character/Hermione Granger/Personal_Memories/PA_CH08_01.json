  "summary": "Hermione continues to dodge questions about her impossible class schedule. When Ron confronts her again about being in two places at once, she deflects sharply, clearly frustrated and under stress. Her usual composure is cracking—she’s irritable, overly defensive, and tense. Despite this, she maintains her academic excellence, attending lessons and staying prepared, but it’s obvious the pressure is mounting. She becomes increasingly isolated, focused more on managing her workload than maintaining her usual balance of academics and friendship.",
