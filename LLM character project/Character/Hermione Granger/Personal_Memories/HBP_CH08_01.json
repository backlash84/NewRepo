  "summary": "Hermione is shocked and disapproving when Snape is announced as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Though she tries to remain composed, it’s clear she sees the decision as both risky and unfair. Later, when Harry shares what he overheard on the train—Draco boasting about Voldemort’s trust—Hermione remains skeptical. She challenges Harry to consider more plausible explanations and warns him not to get obsessed without proof. Her demeanor is cautious, but not unsympathetic. She’s trying to protect Harry from leaping to conclusions, even if she can’t entirely dismiss his fears.",
