  "summary": "Hermione’s strong moral compass is on full display during Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. She reacts with horror to the demonstration of the Unforgivable Curses, particularly the Cruciatus Curse on the spider. Her concern isn’t just academic—it’s visceral and emotional. She challenges the practice of using live animals for such displays, clearly disturbed. Though she doesn’t protest openly in class, her tension is noticeable, and she speaks in hushed, upset tones afterward. Her ethical discomfort sets her apart from some classmates, who are more fascinated than horrified.",
