  "summary": "Hermione takes the first steps toward formal activism by founding S.P.E.W. (the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare). She’s frustrated by her friends’ dismissive attitudes—particularly Ron, who mocks her efforts—but remains undeterred. Her tone becomes more clipped and determined as she explains the group’s goals, which include fair wages and working conditions for house-elves. She pushes Harry and Ron to join, even drawing up badges and official titles. Her unwavering dedication to justice shows a new level of initiative, though it also highlights the social disconnect she feels as few others take her seriously.",
