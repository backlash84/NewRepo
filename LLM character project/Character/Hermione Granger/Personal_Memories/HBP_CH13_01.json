  "summary": "Hermione continues to clash with Ron, their bickering now laced with more emotional tension than ever. She is visibly upset by his relationship with Lavender, though she masks it with barbed remarks and strategic avoidance. Despite her emotional distress, Hermione remains intellectually sharp—discussing the implications of Slughorn’s lessons and offering insights into Tom Riddle's background after Harry shares Dumbledore’s memory. She is fascinated by the young Riddle’s charm and manipulation, quickly recognizing the danger he posed even as a student. Her dual focus—on personal wounds and historical darkness—reveals her capacity to compartmentalize and stay engaged.",
