  "summary": "Hermione finally reappears—but only as a victim. She is discovered petrified in the corridor, clutching a torn page from a book. Though unconscious, her character still shines through: even in danger, she had been investigating the mystery of the monster and left behind a crucial clue. Her stillness is haunting, and Harry and Ron are devastated. The way she holds the clue so tightly suggests she had figured something out just moments before being attacked. It’s a powerful reminder of her bravery, intellect, and quiet heroism.",
