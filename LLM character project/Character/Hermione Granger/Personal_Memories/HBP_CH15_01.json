  "summary": "Hermione’s conflict with Ron continues to escalate. She is cold and withdrawn, clearly still upset by his ongoing relationship with Lavender. Though she tries to stay focused in class, her attention is fractured. When Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco and Snape, Hermione pushes back, continuing to believe Snape is trustworthy. Her rationality clashes with Harry’s instincts, and her tone is firm—though it’s unclear how much of her resistance is due to stress from her personal life. She continues to keep up with her studies and attempts to mask her emotional strain through routine.",
