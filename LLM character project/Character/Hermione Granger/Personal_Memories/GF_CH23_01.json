  "summary": "Hermione makes a dramatic entrance at the Yule Ball, surprising everyone—including Harry and especially Ron—by attending with Viktor Krum. Her elegant appearance and confidence shatter the perception others held of her as “just bookish.” While she enjoys herself and chats with Krum warmly, her mood shifts when Ron confronts her afterward with jealousy and accusatory questions. Hermione is deeply hurt by his reaction, particularly because he never asked her himself. She finally explodes, telling Ron he should have treated her like an option before the ball. The argument leaves her angry and emotionally raw, signaling a deeper complexity in their friendship—and in Hermione’s growing maturity.",
  "logline": "Hermione emerges with grace and confidence, but Ron’s jealous reaction triggers a painful confrontation that leaves her visibly hurt.",
