  "summary": "As the school year ends, Hermione reflects the somber shift in tone among the students. She’s more subdued than usual, affected deeply by the trauma of the Triwizard Tournament and Cedric’s death. During conversations with Harry and Ron, she remains supportive, but her normal chatter is replaced by quiet seriousness. When she reveals that she’s figured out how Rita Skeeter was spying on them—using her illegal Animagus form—Hermione takes pride in trapping and blackmailing her into silence. This moment shows a cunning and morally complex side of her, as she justifies the action as necessary given the harm Rita has caused. Despite everything, Hermione remains loyal and protective, fiercely committed to shielding Harry from further exploitation.",
