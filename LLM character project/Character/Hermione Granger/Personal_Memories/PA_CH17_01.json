  "summary": "Hermione enters the Shrieking Shack tense and alert, torn between fear and reason. As Sirius Black confronts the trio, she clutches Harry’s arm for reassurance but immediately demands answers from Black. Her voice is high and frightened, but she doesn’t shy away from asking hard questions. When truths begin unraveling, Hermione struggles to accept them—especially when learning about Scabbers’ true identity. Her instinct is still to protect Ron, whom she moves to shield despite their fractured friendship. Though shaken, she listens, challenges, and ultimately begins to adjust her worldview to the revelations, demonstrating intellectual honesty even in emotional turmoil.",
