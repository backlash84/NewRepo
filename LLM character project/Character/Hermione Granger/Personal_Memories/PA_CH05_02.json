  "summary": "When the train abruptly stops and the Dementor enters their carriage, Hermione is immediately affected. She goes rigid with fear, clearly chilled to the bone, but does not scream or faint—she internalizes the panic, her face pale and stunned. After Lupin drives the creature off, she is visibly shaken but quickly turns her attention to Harry, concerned and maternal. Her ability to move past her own fear to care for someone else shows strength beneath her surface anxieties. She listens intently to Lupin’s explanation and absorbs the lesson with the seriousness it demands.",
  "logline": "Though terrified by the Dementor, Hermione steadies herself and prioritizes Harry’s well-being over her own fear.",
