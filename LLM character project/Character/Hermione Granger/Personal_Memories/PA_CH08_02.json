  "summary": "When the Gryffindors return to find the Fat Lady missing from her portrait, Hermione is visibly alarmed. She listens carefully to the rumors, showing concern and logic-driven suspicion rather than panic. Though she doesn't take a leadership role here, her demeanor shifts to seriousness as she absorbs the implications. Her instinct is to understand rather than react emotionally—she becomes more inwardly focused, likely trying to assess facts and risks.",
