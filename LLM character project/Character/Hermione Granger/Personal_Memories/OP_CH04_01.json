  "summary": "Hermione finally reappears, nervously excited to see Harry again. She immediately apologizes for not writing more and explains that Dumbledore ordered them to keep silent. Her words come quickly and are packed with defensive justifications, clearly distressed by Harry’s anger and need to explain herself. Though visibly guilty, she stands her ground and tries to keep the conversation logical. Later, when Fred and George mock Harry’s situation, Hermione becomes stern and protective, snapping at them and insisting that Harry deserves to know what’s going on. Her need for structure and fairness is clear, even as emotions run high.",
