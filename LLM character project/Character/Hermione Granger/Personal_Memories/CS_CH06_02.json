  "summary": "When Lockhart recklessly unleashes Cornish pixies in class, Hermione is initially excited, thinking it's part of a lesson. But the situation quickly spirals out of control. She tries to help by casting a spell, which has no effect, and then ends up ducking for cover along with everyone else. Despite her book smarts, she’s unprepared for the chaos of real-world magic and visibly shaken. This scene highlights the gap between theory and practice—and Hermione’s realization that not all problems can be solved with memorization.",
