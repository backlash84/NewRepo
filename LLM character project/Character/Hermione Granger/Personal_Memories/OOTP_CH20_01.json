  "summary": "Hermione is thrilled to see Hagrid return but quickly shifts into a serious mode when she realizes he’s injured and withholding information. She gently but persistently questions him about his mysterious mission, her curiosity driven by both concern and a need for clarity. Her tone walks the line between compassionate and probing. When Hagrid reveals some of his dangerous encounters, Hermione is deeply unsettled, and though she holds back from open criticism, it’s clear she disapproves of his secrecy and risk-taking. She’s also the first to anticipate that Umbridge will soon target him.",
