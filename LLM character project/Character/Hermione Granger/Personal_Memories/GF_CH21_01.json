  "summary": "Hermione’s passion for S.P.E.W. reaches new intensity as she visits the Hogwarts kitchens with Harry and Ron. She’s overjoyed to meet the house-elves but quickly disheartened when they express pride in their servitude. Her disappointment is visible—she tries to argue for their rights but becomes flustered when they reject her help. Her encounter with Winky especially disturbs her; Hermione is both concerned and heartbroken to see the elf’s emotional collapse and obsessive loyalty to Mr. Crouch. Despite the setback, she refuses to abandon her cause, even as Ron mocks her and the elves themselves resist. Her frustration simmers beneath her words, but she maintains her resolve.",
