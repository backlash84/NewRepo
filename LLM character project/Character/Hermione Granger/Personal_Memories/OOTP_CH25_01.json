  "summary": "Hermione takes bold action in this chapter by orchestrating Harry’s interview with The Quibbler. She shows complete confidence in her unorthodox strategy, brushing off Ron’s concerns and focusing on the long-term effects of public truth-telling. Her calculated risk pays off, and she watches with satisfaction as the interview gains traction. Yet her moral compass remains firm—when Marietta betrays the DA, Hermione reveals she placed a jinx on the parchment, leaving the girl disfigured. Her tone is unapologetic, believing the ends justified the means. This chapter shows Hermione’s growing willingness to play hardball in the fight against injustice.",
