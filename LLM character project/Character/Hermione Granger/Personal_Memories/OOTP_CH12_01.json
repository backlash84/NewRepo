  "summary": "Hermione is appalled by Umbridge’s refusal to teach practical defensive magic. She immediately challenges the Ministry’s approach, asserting the need for real-world preparation. Her anger builds as Umbridge reveals the theory-only curriculum, and Hermione becomes one of the first students to openly question the professor’s authority. Though she’s careful in her wording, her objections are unmistakably bold. This chapter marks a turning point for Hermione, where her respect for authority begins to fracture in favor of moral responsibility and resistance. Her concern for Harry also grows, as she watches his fury mount in response to Umbridge’s provocations.",
