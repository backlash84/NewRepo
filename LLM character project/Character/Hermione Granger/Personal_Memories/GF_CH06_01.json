  "summary": "At the Burrow, Hermione is drawn into an argument about Fred and George’s secret joke shop operation. While the twins and Ron are amused by their entrepreneurial antics, Hermione takes a hard stance, expressing disapproval over their use of school funds for unregulated experiments. Her tone is critical, but not unkind—she genuinely cares about safety and rules. Even when Ron teases her, she doesn’t back down, asserting her position with sharp reasoning. This moment reinforces her moral backbone and willingness to voice unpopular opinions, especially when principles are involved.",
