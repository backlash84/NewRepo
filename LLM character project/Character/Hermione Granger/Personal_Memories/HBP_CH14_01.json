  "summary": "Hermione remains hurt by Ron’s relationship with Lavender and is emotionally distant throughout much of the chapter. Her responses to Ron are sharp, laced with jealousy, and she often avoids him altogether. Despite this, she’s still mentally engaged, helping Harry interpret Slughorn’s lessons and showing interest in the Felix Felicis potion. When Harry earns Slughorn’s praise thanks to the Half-Blood Prince’s notes, Hermione’s disapproval resurfaces—she’s still uncomfortable with Harry relying on an unknown source, no matter how effective. Her internal conflict—balancing ethics, emotion, and intellect—is at the forefront.",
