  "summary": "Hermione is present when Dumbledore invites Harry to his office and reveals the memory of Voldemort’s maternal lineage. Though the memory itself focuses on the Gaunt family, Hermione is seen before and after the lesson, engaging Harry with concern and curiosity. She is eager to understand what Dumbledore is teaching him and speculates intelligently about its relevance. However, her wariness about the Half-Blood Prince’s book remains; she continues to discourage Harry from relying on it, even as she recognizes that he’s gaining praise. Her protective instincts and deep unease over hidden knowledge define her tone throughout.",
  "logline": "Hermione remains intellectually curious but increasingly uneasy, urging caution as Harry delves deeper into both past and power.",
