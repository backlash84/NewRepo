  "summary": "After the match, Hermione witnesses Draco Malfoy call her a “Mudblood.” At first, she doesn’t understand the term, but quickly realizes it’s a slur. Her expression changes to one of quiet shock, but she doesn’t lash out—her response is subdued and controlled. Later, she brushes it off logically, calling it “a nasty name” but insisting it doesn’t matter. Internally, however, it clearly shakes her. She leans on intellectual understanding to mask deeper hurt, revealing both strength and vulnerability.",
