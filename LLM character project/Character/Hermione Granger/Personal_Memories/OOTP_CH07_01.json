  "summary": "Hermione is largely in the background during this chapter, accompanying Harry and Mr. Weasley to the Ministry for his hearing. She offers Harry support at breakfast before he leaves, though she doesn't say muchâ€”likely sensing his nervousness. Her presence is reassuring, acting as a quiet signal that she and the others care about him deeply, even if they can't accompany him to the hearing itself. Though not involved in the events at the Ministry, her subdued farewell reinforces her emotional awareness and subtle empathy.",
