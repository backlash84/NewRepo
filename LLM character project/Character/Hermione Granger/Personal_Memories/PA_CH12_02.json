  "scene_title": "Isolation and Tension",
  "summary": "Still on the outs with Harry and Ron, Hermione keeps mostly to herself. She’s emotionally strained and buried in coursework, still managing her impossible schedule without complaint. She avoids conflict directly but is clearly upset—her silences are heavier than usual. Even Crookshanks becomes a point of tension, as Ron grows increasingly hostile over the cat’s behavior. Hermione defends her pet but does so with a tight, brittle tone, avoiding prolonged arguments. Her emotional restraint is more telling than anything she says—she’s hurt but unwilling to compromise her principles.",
  "logline": "Hermione copes with fractured friendships through silence, determination, and emotional restraint.",
