  "summary": "Hermione plays a quieter role in this chapter but is emotionally supportive as Harry grapples with the aftermath of Aragog’s burial and his successful attempt to retrieve Slughorn’s memory. She doesn’t accompany Harry on the mission, but she is quick to ask about the result and reacts with relief when he succeeds. Her tone is gentle and proud, and though she has lingering misgivings about Felix Felicis and the Half-Blood Prince, she acknowledges the importance of what Harry has done. Hermione’s emotional distance from earlier chapters has eased, replaced by quiet solidarity and encouragement.",
  "logline": "Hermione offers calm support as Harry succeeds in a major step forward, setting aside her doubts in favor of shared trust.",
