  "summary": "As they retrace the past three hours, Hermione keeps close track of time and events, directing Harry and keeping them both on task. Her precision is remarkable—she remembers details others wouldn’t notice and insists on timing everything down to the minute. Even when anxious, she remains in control, channeling her fear into focus. Her compassion shows through too—she beams when Buckbeak is saved and silently supports Harry as he wrestles with the temptation to act. Her leadership never overshadows Harry, but without her guidance, the entire plan would have fallen apart.",
