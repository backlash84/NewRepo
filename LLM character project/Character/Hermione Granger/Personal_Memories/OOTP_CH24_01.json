  "summary": "Hermione stands by Harry during a particularly vulnerable moment—his fear that he might be possessed by Voldemort. While Ron reacts with visible discomfort, Hermione immediately refutes Harry’s self-doubt with reason and compassion. She assures him that his emotions—guilt, love, fear—are proof he’s not like Voldemort. Her logic is used not coldly, but as a form of comfort. Hermione’s grounding presence is essential here: she listens, reassures, and gives Harry the emotional clarity he needs. In a chapter heavy with fear and uncertainty, she offers something solid—trust in who Harry truly is.",
  "logline": "When Harry doubts his own soul, Hermione responds with compassion and logic, anchoring him in truth.",
