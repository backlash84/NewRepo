  "summary": "After the party, Hermione, Harry, and Ron discover the message written on the wall about the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is stunned by the threatening tone and the mention of the “Heir of Slytherin.” She stays silent while others react more emotionally—processing the threat analytically, not impulsively. Her stillness reflects internal calculation and fear. The message seems to shake her deeply, not just because of the danger, but because it signals something magical and ancient she doesn’t yet understand.",
