  "summary": "Hermione immediately grows suspicious when Harry has another vision of Sirius in danger, sensing that something about it doesn’t feel right. As Harry becomes more frantic, she urges him to stop and think, voicing doubts about whether the vision is real or planted. Her caution is overridden when Umbridge catches them in her office, and Hermione shifts tactics instantly—fabricating a lie about a secret weapon to protect Harry. Her performance is calculated and effective, blending fear with just enough plausibility to bait Umbridge. It’s a pivotal moment of improvisation and risk, showing her ability to act under pressure.",
