  "summary": "As the school year ends, Hermione’s role returns to one of steady support. She doesn’t seek attention for her role in saving Sirius and Buckbeak, nor does she revel in praise. When Ron expresses interest in following up with Sirius about getting a pet owl, Hermione supports the idea without bitterness, despite the past tension between them. She also quietly decides to drop Muggle Studies—an acknowledgment that even she has limits. It’s a rare moment of self-kindness from a girl often driven by pressure and perfection. Her tone is lighter, more at ease, and her friendship with Harry and Ron appears restored.",
  "logline": "Hermione ends the year with grace, letting go of pressure and reconnecting with her friends on calmer terms.",
