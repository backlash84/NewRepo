  "summary": "Hermione continues to express serious doubts about Harry’s use of the Half-Blood Prince’s book, especially as he gains even more acclaim in Potions. She challenges him directly, trying to appeal to his sense of fairness and caution. At the same time, she juggles her own heavy workload and social discomfort—particularly around Slughorn’s favoritism. Her frustration becomes evident when she fails to get the same recognition despite her hard work. When Ron starts seeing Lavender, Hermione is clearly upset, though she attempts to hide it. Her emotions simmer beneath the surface, blending academic rigor with emerging personal turmoil.",
