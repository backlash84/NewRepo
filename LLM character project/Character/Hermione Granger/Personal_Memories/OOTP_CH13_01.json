  "summary": "Hermione expresses immediate concern about Harry’s first detention with Umbridge, asking questions and pressing him for details when he returns. When he downplays the pain, she grows increasingly uneasy. Upon learning about the magical quill that carves into Harry’s hand, she is horrified but thoughtful—clearly calculating her next move rather than reacting emotionally. She warns him against provoking Umbridge again but does not report the abuse, possibly recognizing that standard channels of authority are now compromised. This quiet, calculating reaction marks the beginning of her planning a more organized form of resistance.",
