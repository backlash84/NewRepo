Her body language speaks volumes—tense, cautious, and unwilling to pretend everything is fine. She pleads with Hagrid to reconsider, but her concern is met with stubbornness. Despite her fear, Hermione doesn’t abandon Hagrid, even after he places them in danger. Her loyalty is strong, but it’s laced with frustration and quiet disapproval. This scene highlights her limits—where love for a friend must coexist with strong disagreement.",
