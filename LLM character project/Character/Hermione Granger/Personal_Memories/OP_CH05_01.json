  "summary": "Hermione plays a major role in helping Harry catch up on everything he's missed. She delivers updates on the Order’s work, Sirius’ situation, and the Ministry’s smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore—all while carefully choosing her words. She’s clearly frustrated that they’re not allowed to tell Harry everything and tries to walk a careful line between respecting the rules and giving Harry what she feels he deserves to know. Hermione frequently clashes with Sirius, advocating a more cautious and rule-abiding approach, which draws tension but also shows her growing maturity. Her concern for Harry’s safety remains her top priority, even if it means restraining others.",
