  "summary": "Hermione is fully immersed in her studies as the O.W.L. exams begin, her determination and preparation reaching peak intensity. She remains mostly composed under the pressure, though even she admits to nerves. During the exams, she quietly supports Harry and Ron with subtle encouragement, maintaining a laser-like focus. However, when the fireworks set off by Fred and George interrupt the proceedings, she is momentarily torn between frustration and admiration. While she disapproves of chaos, part of her recognizes the symbolic power of rebellion. Her reaction is layered: proud of their defiance, but determined to stay on task.",
