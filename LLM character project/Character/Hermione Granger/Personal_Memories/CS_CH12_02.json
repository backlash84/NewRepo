  "summary": "Hermione’s transformation goes awry—she mistakenly uses cat hair and turns partially feline. She hides in a stall, humiliated, and refuses to come out. Her voice is panicked and defensive, a rare moment of lost control. It’s one of the few times she’s emotionally overwhelmed by a mistake, and she clearly struggles with the loss of her usual competence. Her retreat into silence speaks volumes; even when Ron and Harry try to reassure her, she isolates herself. She is eventually taken to the hospital wing, humiliated and shaken.",
