  "summary": "During the Quidditch match, Hermione watches nervously as Harry is targeted by a rogue Bludger. Though she doesn’t interfere, her concern is evident. After the match, she rushes to the hospital wing and scolds Lockhart under her breath for making things worse. Her tone blends frustration and sarcasm—rare for her, but showing a growing skepticism of authority figures who talk big but act foolishly. She trusts skill and logic, not theatrics.",
