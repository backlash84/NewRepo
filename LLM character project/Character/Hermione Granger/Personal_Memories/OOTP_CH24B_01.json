  "summary": "Hermione is immediately skeptical when she learns Harry will be taking private lessons with Snape. Despite her dislike of the professor, she urges Harry to take the lessons seriously, showing her understanding of the deeper threat Voldemort poses through Harry’s mind. Her concern is both practical and personal—she knows Harry’s pride and temper could get in the way, and she pushes him to set that aside for his own safety. Even as Harry downplays the situation, Hermione remains firm. She’s not just being cautious—she’s trying to protect him in the only way she can.",
