  "summary": "Hermione is not present during the actual hearing at the Ministry, but her concern is keenly felt in the aftermath. When Harry returns to Grimmauld Place after his name is cleared, she is visibly relieved and congratulates him warmly. Her praise is paired with an almost immediate return to business: she transitions quickly to planning ahead, eager to see what Dumbledore will allow them to do next. This moment shows her dual nature—both deeply caring and intellectually driven. Her enthusiasm is laced with a desire for structure and action now that the crisis has passed.",
