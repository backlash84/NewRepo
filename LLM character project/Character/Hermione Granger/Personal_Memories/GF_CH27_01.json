  "summary": "Hermione is present during Harry and Ron’s conversation about the outcome of the Second Task and how the scores were awarded. She tries to steer their attention back to preparing for the third task, emphasizing that Harry needs to practice and stay ahead. Her patience with Ron’s distractions is thin, and she’s clearly frustrated by his constant sarcasm and laziness. When Harry receives a message from Sirius and plans to meet him, Hermione joins without hesitation. She listens closely as Sirius shares information about Barty Crouch’s erratic behavior, and her thoughtful questions reflect her sharp intuition. Throughout, Hermione balances emotional support for Harry with a strategic mindset, keenly focused on uncovering what’s really going on at Hogwarts.",
