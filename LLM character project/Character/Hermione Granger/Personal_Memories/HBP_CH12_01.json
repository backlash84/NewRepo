  "summary": "Hermione’s jealousy over Ron and Lavender deepens in this chapter, though she tries to conceal it beneath sarcasm and aloofness. Her usual sharpness is tinged with emotional strain, particularly when Ron dismisses her concerns. Still, she remains engaged in broader matters—discussing Slughorn’s favoritism, warning Harry about the Half-Blood Prince’s shortcuts, and reacting with alarm when Katie Bell is cursed. Her concern for Katie is immediate and genuine, and her tone shifts from personal frustration to serious worry. The incident serves as a stark reminder that the threat of Voldemort is never far away.",
  "logline": "Caught between personal hurt and rising danger, Hermione juggles emotional control with growing concern over dark events.",
