  "summary": "Hermione shows deep concern when Harry finally arrives at the Burrow, injured and shaken. She is horrified to learn that Moody is dead and George has lost an ear, her reaction a mix of grief and helplessness. Her protective instincts flare when Harry reveals he tried to disarm rather than harm, and she defends his decision passionately. When Scrimgeour appears later, Hermione is tense and skeptical, showing how her mistrust of authority has grown. This chapter highlights both her emotional vulnerability and her protective, increasingly defiant stance against those she deems untrustworthy.",
