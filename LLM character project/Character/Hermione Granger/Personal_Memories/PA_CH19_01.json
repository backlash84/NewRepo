  "summary": "Hermione starts the chapter still stunned but slowly accepts the truth about Peter Pettigrew. As more details come out, she grows bolder—supporting Lupin and Sirius’s plan to reveal Pettigrew rather than kill him. She speaks with quiet urgency, her voice still shaking but resolute. Her moral compass is clear: she agrees Pettigrew deserves punishment but wants it handled legally. When Snape storms in, Hermione pleads for calm, trying to de-escalate the situation, but he ignores her. Even then, she stays close to Harry and Ron, choosing courage and clarity in a moment of high emotional tension.",
