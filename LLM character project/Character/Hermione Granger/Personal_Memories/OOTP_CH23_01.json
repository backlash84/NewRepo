  "summary": "Hermione travels with the Weasleys and friends to St. Mungo’s to visit Mr. Weasley. Though she speaks less than usual, her emotional intelligence shines through in her quiet support. She stays close to Harry and is clearly observing everyone—gauging reactions, reading the room. When they encounter Gilderoy Lockhart and later witness Neville’s painful family moment, Hermione is deeply moved but refrains from intruding. Her empathy is palpable, and she later helps maintain a sense of normalcy. Her restraint shows a maturing understanding of when words help—and when silence says more.",
