  "summary": "Hermione plays a key emotional role in this chapter, providing steady support to Harry before his first Triwizard task. Though she’s visibly nervous for him, she suppresses her own anxiety to help him stay calm. She doesn’t try to talk him out of it or express panic—instead, she reinforces his courage and stands by him. When Harry reveals what the first task will be, Hermione is horrified by the danger, but she helps him strategize and keeps his secret. Her blend of intellect, restraint, and care is subtle but powerful, especially in the hours leading up to the challenge.",
