  "summary": "Hermione attends the new Duelling Club with excitement, intrigued by the chance to learn real defensive magic. During the demonstration between Snape and Lockhart, she watches closely, eager to absorb the technique. She’s more excited than skeptical at first, but her face darkens as Lockhart bungles his spellwork. Her admiration is visibly fading, replaced by a more grounded view of competence. This marks the continued erosion of her starry-eyed respect for authority when it lacks merit.",
