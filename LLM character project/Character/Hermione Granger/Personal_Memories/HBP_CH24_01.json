Her moral stance is unwavering—she scolds Harry for being reckless and is horrified by the spell’s violent power. This moment reignites her longstanding distrust of the book, and she urges Harry more strongly than ever to get rid of it. Her tone is deeply concerned, blending anger with fear. She also continues to navigate her emotional entanglement with Ron, who has finally broken things off with Lavender, though their own status remains unclear.",
