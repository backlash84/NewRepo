  "summary": "Although she does not appear in person, Hermione's presence is felt through a letter she sends to Harry. Her tone is warm and characteristically informative, filled with small updates and a note of excitement about the Quidditch World Cup. She expresses concern about Harry’s scar hurting and encourages him to write to Dumbledore if he feels unwell. Even in a short note, Hermione’s balance of care and logic comes through—she offers emotional support but also a clear, sensible course of action. It reflects her steady influence on Harry, even from afar.",
